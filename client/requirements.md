## Packages
recharts | For visualization of energy trends and limit boundaries
framer-motion | For smooth state transitions and animations
clsx | Utility for conditional class names
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes

## Notes
Tailwind Config: Extend fontFamily with 'JetBrains Mono' for data and 'Inter' for UI.
API: The engine evaluation endpoint is stateless, but we need to maintain local simulation state in the frontend.
